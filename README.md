# Data_Science_Course_iLong

Here's the course material for iLong, the top long-term care service web platform in Taiwan. The course members are from different position, including software engineer, PM, marketing and operation.

# About the course
The materials are mostly from the course "Data Mining"
The course would focus more on data analytical goals and try to reduce math as much as possible
The goal of the course series is make you think like a data analyst, think with model
The course is full of discussions. Sit tight!
I suggest you will still not be able to execute a predictive analysis project after this course.
However, with some help of AutoML tools or engineer, you could exploit the power of predictive analysis with the logic in this course.
