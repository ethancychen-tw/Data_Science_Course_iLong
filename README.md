# Data_Science_Course_iLong

Here's the course material for iLong, the top long-term care service web platform in Taiwan. The course students are from different position:  software engineer, PM, marketing and operation.

# About the course
- The materials are mostly from the course "Data Mining"
- The course would focus more on data analytical goals and try avoid too much math details (You only need high school math)
- The goal of the course series is make you **`think`** like a data analyst, think with model
- The course is `full of discussions`. Sit tight!
- I suggest you will still not be able to execute a predictive analysis project on your own after this course.
- However, with some help of AutoML tools or engineers, you could leverage the power of predictive analysis with the logic in this course
